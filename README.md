## Global Carbon Pricing & Emissions Tracker

This Excel dashboard explores how carbon pricing is being used globally to combat climate change. I analyzed World Bank and EU ETS data to compare carbon prices across countries, track adoption since 2010, and examine whether these policies are reducing emissions. Built with Power Query, pivot tables, and interactive slicers.
